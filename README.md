# User_Id_Generation
User_ID_Generation

This one is a very simple and easy code for generating a user id key by using first name , last name, pin code, and a key of a user.
This type of question is asked in previous interviews of Infosys, Wipro, tcs and many other MNCS.
So, it was a part of previous years placement question of infosys exam.
This time it is asked in Ifytq or Infosys springboard problems.

So, in this repository you will get a complete source code in java language.


Question: User key Generation
Input: First Name(String), Last Name(String), Pin Code(int), a key(n-int)(must be 0 to pin.length)

How to get user id?
You can easily get the user id as follows:- LastLetter of smaller string among first and last name + entire longer string + digit at position n in the pin when traversing the pin from left to right + digit at position n in the pin when traversing the pin from right to left.

Go to the source code https://github.com/Vivekagrahari13/User_Id_Generation/blob/main/UserIdGeneration.java and enjoy the coding journey.
